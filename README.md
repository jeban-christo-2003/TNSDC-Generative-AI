Potato Disease Classification Project
Overview
This project focuses on the classification of two major potato diseases: late blight (caused by Phytophthora infestans) and early blight (caused by Alternaria solani). By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project aims to develop models capable of accurately identifying and distinguishing between these two diseases based on images of infected potato plants.
